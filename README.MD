# Assignment 1 README

This repository contains two Python scripts, `assignment1_part1.py` and `assignment1_part2.py`, which fulfill the requirements of Assignment 1. Below, you will find information about each part of the assignment and instructions on how to run the scripts.

## Part 1: Functions and Exceptions

### Description
- In this part, we create a Python script named `assignment1_part1.py` that demonstrates the use of functions and custom exceptions.
- The main components of this part are:
  - A function named `list_divide` that calculates the number of elements in a list that are divisible by a given divisor (default divisor is 2).
  - A custom exception class called `ListDivideException`.
  - A function named `test_list_divide` that performs multiple tests using the `list_divide` function and raises `ListDivideException` if any test fails.

### Usage
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `assignment1_part1.py`.
2. Run the script with the following command:


3. If all tests pass, you will see the message "All tests passed." If any test fails, you will see "At least one test failed."

## Part 2: Simple Class

### Description
- In this part, we create a Python script named `assignment1_part2.py` that demonstrates the creation of a simple class.
- The main components of this part are:
- A class named `Book` with attributes `author` and `title`, and methods `__init__` and `display` for initializing and displaying book information.
- Instantiation of two `Book` objects with different book details and displaying them.

### Usage
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `assignment1_part2.py`.
2. Run the script with the following command:


3. The script will display information about two books as specified in the `display` method.

Feel free to explore and modify these scripts as needed for your assignment. Enjoy learning Python!

**Note:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system to run these scripts.
